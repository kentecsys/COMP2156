Importance of DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

DevOps enhances the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by integrating development and operations teams, 
leading to faster deployments, automation, and continuous delivery.

**How DevOps Improves SDLC:**
- Faster development and deployment cycles.
- Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) reduces release time.
- Improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations teams.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensures consistency and automation.
- Enhanced monitoring and logging for better system reliability.
- DevSecOps ensures security is integrated throughout the SDLC.

Adopting DevOps in SDLC increases efficiency, reduces costs, and enhances software quality.
